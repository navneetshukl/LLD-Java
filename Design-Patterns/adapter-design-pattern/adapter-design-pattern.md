Use the **Adapter Design Pattern** when:

1. **Incompatible Interfaces**: You need to make two incompatible interfaces work together, e.g., integrating a legacy system with a new one.
2. **Reusing Existing Code**: An existing class has the functionality you need, but its interface doesn't match your requirements.
3. **Third-Party Integration**: You want to use a third-party library or component but its interface differs from what your system expects.
4. **Multiple Interfaces**: You need a class to work with multiple interfaces without modifying its code.
5. **Future-Proofing**: You want to create a flexible system where new components can be added with minimal changes.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Converting XML data from an old system to JSON for a modern API.
- Adapting a US plug to fit a European socket (real-world analogy).
- Wrapping a third-party logging library to match your application's logging interface.

**When NOT to Use**:
- If the interfaces are already compatible, adding an adapter is unnecessary overhead.
- If you can modify the source code of one system to match the other, direct changes might be simpler.
- If the adaptation is overly complex, consider refactoring or alternative patterns.

The Adapter Pattern is ideal for bridging gaps between systems while keeping code clean and maintainable.
